## SDLC Automation
 - CI/CD: having our code in a repo and deploy it onto AWS `automatically, the right way, making sure it's tested before being deployed, with possibility to go into different stages(dev, test, staging, prod), with manual approval where needed`.
   - CI: dev push code to the repo, a test/build server checks the code and gives the feedback to the dev.
   - CD: ensure software can be released reliably when needed and deployment happens ofter and quickly
   - tech stack: (code: codeCommit/github/...) -> (build & test: codebuild/jenkins/...) -> (deploy: codeDeploy) -> (provision: EC2/on-prem/lambda/ECS/...)
     - use `Elastic Beanstalk` to cover `deploy` and `provision` stages
     - use `codePipeline` to manager the whole process
 - CodeCommit: version control/ using GIT/ Private repo/ no size limit/ fully managed, HA/ integrate with various CI tools/ Security: ssh key & https(authentication); IAM policies(authorization); encryption(automatically with MKS at rest, in transit, https or ssh); using IAM role and STS (cross-account access)
